# Hi there, I'm Sudip Neupane 👋

I'm a passionate JavaScript/MERN developer, constantly learning and building cool things with code. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'll call myself an inquisitive hustler. I believe in the third eye, a different perspective of thinking to solve even trivial problems. 
Rather than working on a solution, I spend more time analyzing the problem. 
To me, bearing an interest with dedication in a field of opportunity is more important than working in a field of interest. 
It is not my genre to limit our opportunity and thought simply by defining an interest. Omniscient intrigues me more than specialist.
